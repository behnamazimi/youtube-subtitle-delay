# YouTube Subtitle Delay

Mini tool to delay subtitles on the YouTube official website.

**[Chrome Web Store](#)**

As you may know, YouTube doesn't have this functionality by default, and sometimes being able to delay subtitle
streaming can be of great help, especially when you're trying to learn a new language.

This extension is only allowed to execute on the official website of YouTube and I hope they add the subtitle delay
options soon and make this extension useless :)

### How to install?

It's available on **[Chrome Web Store](#)**.

### How to install it manually on Chromium base browsers?

1. Clone the repo or download it as a zip and extract it
2. Go to extensions settings of your browser and active **Developer mode** by clicking the toggle that is already in the
   extensions page. (You can also open extensions' page by going to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions` for
   Edge or, `opera://extensions` for Opera browser)
3. At the same page, click on **Load unpacked** button and load the folder you just cloned or the zip
   file you have downloaded.
4. Enjoy! :)
